## Abstract of the project
Traditional geospatial analysis tools often require specialized training, limiting accessibility and usability. Manual input and processing of geospatial data can be time-consuming and prone to errors. There is a growing demand for user-friendly platforms that streamline geospatial exploration, enhance data interaction, and provide actionable insights in real-time. Additionally, integrating natural language processing (NLP) techniques can further enhance user experience by allowing natural language queries for geospatial analysis tasks. Hence, this project aims to develop a user-friendly and efficient online platform for geospatial analysis, seamlessly integrating NLP capabilities, map exploration functionalities, geospatial analysis techniques, and machine learning algorithms. By bridging the gap between complex geospatial data and user-friendly interfaces, this platform empowers users to extract meaningful insights and make
informed decisions based on geospatial data analysis.
